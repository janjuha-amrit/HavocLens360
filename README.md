HavocLens360 Flood and Fire Detection with Web Technologies This web application is a testament to the power of web development for real-time object detection! It utilizes your device's camera and a custom-trained model to identify potential fire and flood hazards in your surroundings.

Key Features:

Real-time Detection: Analyzes the live camera feed for signs of fire and flood, keeping you vigilant. Custom-built Model: Leverages a model trained specifically for fire and flood detection, built from scratch using powerful web technologies. Visual Feedback: Highlights detected objects (fire and flood) with bounding boxes and labels for clear identification. Performance Monitoring: Displays the real-time frames per second (FPS) to gauge processing performance. How it Works:

User Media Access: The application first requests access to your device's camera (environment mode by default) and retrieves a live video stream. Model Loading: It then loads a pre-trained model, meticulously crafted using web technologies, to identify fire and flood patterns within the video frames. Continuous Detection: The application continuously analyzes each frame of the video stream using the custom-built model. Prediction and Visualization: If fire or flood is detected, the model generates predictions including bounding boxes and class labels (fire/flood) which are then visualized on the live camera feed. Performance Measurement:The application calculates and displays the real-time frames per second (FPS) to provide insights into processing performance. Requirements:

A webcam connected to your device. A basic understanding of web development concepts like machine learning and object detection (This doesn't require a Roboflow account). Disclaimer: This is a simplified implementation for demonstration purposes. Further development is required for real-world applications, such as integrating with alarm systems or emergency response services.
